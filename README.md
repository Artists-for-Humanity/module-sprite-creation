# Building Sprite Sheets
A sprite is a two-dimensional bitmap that is integrated into a larger scene, most often in a 2D video game.  
Sprite sheets are comprised of several sprites in a single image file.  
JPEG and PNG are both common bitmap file types.

## Why Use Sprite Sheets?
One major reason to use sprite sheets is for memory's sake.
One file containing all images would take up less memory than if all images were their own files.  
It also makes organization simpler, since your are dealing with less clutter, and sprites will ideally be logically grouped.

### Logical Grouping?
When we say "logically grouped," we mean to say that sprite sheets will contain all assets needed for a specific object or setting.  
For example, you may "logically group" all platform or ground tile sprites in one sprite sheet.  
You may also group all  prop or weapon sprites in a single sheet.  
However, this method of grouping is possibly most useful for storing sprite animations.

## Animations
What is an animation?  
Simply put, an animation is a series of unique images shown sequentially to give the illusion of motion.
